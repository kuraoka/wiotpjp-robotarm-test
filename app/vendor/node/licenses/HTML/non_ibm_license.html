rights.  You may have other rights under the laws of your country.

13.  Disclaimer of Warranty.   The software is licensed "as-
is."  You bear the risk of using it.  Microsoft gives no express 
warranties, guarantees or conditions.  You may have additional consumer

party programs; and<br>

warranty, guarantee or condition, strict liability, negligence, or 
other tort to the extent permitted by applicable law.<br>
It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known

exclusion may not apply to you because your country may not allow the 
exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential or other damages.<br>

devrait connaître l'éventualité d'un tel dommage.  Si votre pays 
n'autorise pas l'exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les 
dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il 
se peut que la limitation ou l'exclusion ci-dessus ne 
s'appliquera pas à votre égard.<br>

juridiques. Vous pourriez avoir d'autres droits prévus par les lois de 
votre pays.  Le présent contrat ne modifie pas les droits que
