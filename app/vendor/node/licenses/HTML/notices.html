    5. Time Zone Database<br>
    ICU uses the public domain data and code derived from<br>
    Time Zone Database for its time zone support. The 
ownership of the TZ database is explained<br>
    in BCP 175: Procedure for Maintaining the Time Zone<br>
    Database section 7.<br>
<br>
    7.  Database Ownership<br>
<br>
       The TZ database itself is not an IETF Contribution 
or an IETF<br>
       document.  Rather it is a pre-existing and regularly 
updated work<br>
       that is in the public domain, and is intended to 
remain in the public<br>
       domain.  Therefore, BCPs 78 [RFC5378] and 79 
[RFC3979] do not apply<br>
       to the TZ Database or contributions that individuals 
make to it.<br>
       Should any claims be made and substantiated against 
the TZ Database,<br>
       the organization that is providing the IANA 
Considerations defined in<br>
       this RFC, under the memorandum of understanding with 
the IETF,<br>
       currently ICANN, may act in accordance with all 
competent court<br>
       orders.  No ownership claims will be made by ICANN 
or the IETF Trust<br>
       on the database or the code.  Any person making a 
contribution to the<br>
       database or code waives all rights to future claims 
in that<br>
       contribution or in the TZ Database.<br>

    modifications made available from the Copyright 
Holder.  The resulting<br>
    Package will still be considered the Standard Version, 
and as such<br>
    will be subject to the Original License.<br>
<br>
    Distribution of Modified Versions of the Package as 
Source<br>
<br>
    (4)  You may Distribute your Modified Version as Source 
(either gratis<br>
    or for a Distributor Fee, and with or without a 
Compiled form of the<br>
    Modified Version) provided that you clearly document 
how it differs<br>
    from the Standard Version, including, but not limited 
to, documenting<br>
    any non-standard features, executables, or modules, and 
provided that<br>
    you do at least ONE of the following:<br>
<br>
        (a)  make the Modified Version available to the 
Copyright Holder<br>
        of the Standard Version, under the Original 
License, so that the<br>
        Copyright Holder may include your modifications in 
the Standard<br>
        Version.<br>
<br>
        (b)  ensure that installation of your Modified 
Version does not<br>
        prevent the user installing or running the Standard 
Version. In<br>
        addition, the Modified Version must bear a name 
that is different<br>
        from the name of the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
        (c)  allow anyone who receives a copy of the 
Modified Version to<br>
        make the Source form of the Modified Version 
available to others<br>
        under<br>
<br>
            (i)  the Original License or<br>
<br>
            (ii)  a license that permits the licensee to 
freely copy,<br>
            modify and redistribute the Modified Version 
using the same<br>
            licensing terms that apply to the copy that the 
licensee<br>
            received, and requires that the Source form of 
the Modified<br>
            Version, and of any works derived from it, be 
made freely<br>
            available in that license fees are prohibited 
but Distributor<br>
            Fees are allowed.<br>
<br>
    Distribution of Compiled Forms of the Standard Version<br>
    or Modified Versions without the Source<br>
<br>
    (5)  You may Distribute Compiled forms of the Standard 
Version without<br>
    the Source, provided that you include complete 
instructions on how to<br>
    get the Source of the Standard Version.  Such 
instructions must be<br>
    valid at the time of your distribution.  If these 
instructions, at any<br>
    time while you are carrying out such distribution, 
become invalid, you<br>
    must provide new instructions on demand or cease 
further distribution.<br>
    If you provide valid instructions or cease distribution 
within thirty<br>
    days after you become aware that the instructions are 
invalid, then<br>
    you do not forfeit any of your rights under this 
license.<br>
<br>
    (6)  You may Distribute a Modified Version in Compiled 
form without<br>
    the Source, provided that you comply with Section 4 
with respect to<br>
    the Source of the Modified Version.<br>
<br>
    Aggregating or Linking the Package<br>
<br>
    (7)  You may aggregate the Package (either the Standard 
Version or<br>
    Modified Version) with other packages and Distribute 
the resulting<br>
    aggregation provided that you do not charge a licensing 
fee for the<br>
    Package.  Distributor Fees are permitted, and licensing 
fees for other<br>
    components in the aggregation are permitted. The terms 
of this license<br>
    apply to the use and Distribution of the Standard or 
Modified Versions<br>
    as included in the aggregation.<br>
<br>
    (8) You are permitted to link Modified and Standard 
Versions with<br>
    other works, to embed the Package in a larger work of 
your own, or to<br>
    build stand-alone binary or bytecode versions of 
applications that<br>
    include the Package, and Distribute the result without 
restriction,<br>
    provided the result does not expose a direct interface 
to the Package.<br>
<br>
    Items That are Not Considered Part of a Modified Version<br>
<br>
    (9) Works (including, but not limited to, modules and 
scripts) that<br>
    merely extend or make use of the Package, do not, by 
themselves, cause<br>
    the Package to be a Modified Version.  In addition, 
such works are not<br>
    considered parts of the Package itself, and are not 
subject to the<br>
    terms of this license.<br>
<br>
    General Provisions<br>
<br>
    (10)  Any use, modification, and distribution of the 
Standard or<br>
    Modified Versions is governed by this Artistic License. 
By using,<br>
    modifying or distributing the Package, you accept this 
license. Do not<br>
    use, modify, or distribute the Package, if you do not 
accept this<br>
    license.<br>
<br>
    (11)  If your Modified Version has been derived from a 
Modified<br>
    Version made by someone other than you, you are 
nevertheless required<br>
    to ensure that your Modified Version complies with the 
requirements of<br>
    this license.<br>
<br>
    (12)  This license does not grant you the right to use 
any trademark,<br>
    service mark, tradename, or logo of the Copyright 
Holder.<br>
<br>
    (13)  This license includes the non-exclusive, 
worldwide,<br>
    free-of-charge patent license to make, have made, use, 
offer to sell,<br>
    sell, import and otherwise transfer the Package with 
respect to any<br>
    patent claims licensable by the Copyright Holder that 
are necessarily<br>
    infringed by the Package. If you institute patent 
litigation<br>
    (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any 
party alleging<br>
    that the Package constitutes direct or contributory 
patent<br>
    infringement, then this Artistic License to you shall 
terminate on the<br>
    date that such litigation is filed.<br>
<br>

part of its<br>
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that 
You distribute must<br>

<br>
The Program includes some or all of the following that IBM 
obtained under<br>
the Artistic License (source code available via the 
indicated URL):" http://dev.perl.org/licenses/artistic.html<br>
<br>
        The intent of this document is to state the 
conditions under which a<br>
        Package may be copied, such that the Copyright 
Holder maintains some<br>
        semblance of artistic control over the development 
of the package,<br>
        while giving the users of the package the right to 
use and distribute<br>
        the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, 
plus the right to make<br>
        reasonable modifications.<br>
<br>
        Definitions:<br>
<br>
            "Package" refers to the collection of files 
distributed by the<br>
            Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that 
collection of files<br>
            created through textual modification.<br>
<br>
            "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if 
it has not been<br>
            modified, or has been modified in accordance 
with the wishes<br>
            of the Copyright Holder as specified below.<br>
<br>
            "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the 
copyright or<br>
            copyrights for the package.<br>
<br>
            "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying 
or distributing<br>
            this Package.<br>
<br>
            "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can 
justify on the<br>
            basis of media cost, duplication charges, time 
of people involved,<br>
            and so on.  (You will not be required to 
justify it to the<br>
            Copyright Holder, but only to the computing 
community at large<br>
            as a market that must bear the fee.)<br>
<br>
            "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged 
for the item<br>
            itself, though there may be fees involved in 
handling the item.<br>
            It also means that recipients of the item may 
redistribute it<br>
            under the same conditions they received it.<br>
<br>
        1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of 
the source form of the<br>
        Standard Version of this Package without 
restriction, provided that you<br>
        duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers.<br>
<br>
        2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and 
other modifications<br>
        derived from the Public Domain or from the 
Copyright Holder.  A Package<br>
        modified in such a way shall still be considered 
the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
        3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this 
Package in any way, provided<br>
        that you insert a prominent notice in each changed 
file stating how and<br>
        when you changed that file, and provided that you 
do at least ONE of the<br>
        following:<br>
<br>
            a) place your modifications in the Public 
Domain or otherwise make them<br>
            Freely Available, such as by posting said 
modifications to Usenet or<br>
            an equivalent medium, or placing the 
modifications on a major archive<br>
            site such as uunet.uu.net, or by allowing the 
Copyright Holder to include<br>
            your modifications in the Standard Version of 
the Package.<br>
<br>
            b) use the modified Package only within your 
corporation or organization.<br>
<br>
            c) rename any non-standard executables so the 
names do not conflict<br>
            with standard executables, which must also be 
provided, and provide<br>
            a separate manual page for each non-standard 
executable that clearly<br>
            documents how it differs from the Standard 
Version.<br>
<br>
            d) make other distribution arrangements with 
the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
        4. You may distribute the programs of this Package 
in object code or<br>
        executable form, provided that you do at least ONE 
of the following:<br>
<br>
            a) distribute a Standard Version of the 
executables and library files,<br>
            together with instructions (in the manual page 
or equivalent) on where<br>
            to get the Standard Version.<br>
<br>
            b) accompany the distribution with the machine-
readable source of<br>
            the Package with your modifications.<br>
<br>
            c) give non-standard executables non-standard 
names, and clearly<br>
            document the differences in manual pages (or 
equivalent), together<br>
            with instructions on where to get the Standard 
Version.<br>
<br>
            d) make other distribution arrangements with 
the Copyright Holder.<br>
<br>
        5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any 
distribution of this<br>
        Package.  You may charge any fee you choose for 
support of this<br>
        Package.  You may not charge a fee for this Package 
itself.  However,<br>
        you may distribute this Package in aggregate with 
other (possibly<br>
        commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly 
commercial) software<br>
        distribution provided that you do not advertise 
this Package as a<br>
        product of your own.  You may embed this Package's 
interpreter within<br>
        an executable of yours (by linking); this shall be 
construed as a mere<br>
        form of aggregation, provided that the complete 
Standard Version of the<br>
        interpreter is so embedded.<br>
<br>
        6. The scripts and library files supplied as input 
to or produced as<br>
        output from the programs of this Package do not 
automatically fall<br>
        under the copyright of this Package, but belong to 
whoever generated<br>
        them, and may be sold commercially, and may be 
aggregated with this<br>
        Package.  If such scripts or library files are 
aggregated with this<br>
        Package via the so-called "undump" or "unexec" 
methods of producing a<br>
        binary executable image, then distribution of such 
an image shall<br>
        neither be construed as a distribution of this 
Package nor shall it<br>
        fall under the restrictions of Paragraphs 3 and 4, 
provided that you do<br>
        not represent such an executable image as a 
Standard Version of this<br>
        Package.<br>
<br>
        7. C subroutines (or comparably compiled 
subroutines in other<br>
        languages) supplied by you and linked into this 
Package in order to<br>
        emulate subroutines and variables of the language 
defined by this<br>
        Package shall not be considered part of this 
Package, but are the<br>
        equivalent of input as in Paragraph 6, provided 
these subroutines do<br>
        not change the language in any way that would cause 
it to fail the<br>
        regression tests for the language.<br>
<br>
        8. Aggregation of this Package with a commercial 
distribution is always<br>
        permitted provided that the use of this Package is 
embedded; that is,<br>
        when no overt attempt is made to make this 
Package's interfaces visible<br>
        to the end user of the commercial distribution.  
Such use shall not be<br>
        construed as a distribution of this Package.<br>
