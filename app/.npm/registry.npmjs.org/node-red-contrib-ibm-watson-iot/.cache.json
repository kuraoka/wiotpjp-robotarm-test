pair of Node-RED nodes for connecting to the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform\nas a Device or Gateway.\n\n## Install\n\nRun the following command in the user directory of your Node-RED install. This is\nusually ``~/.node-red`.\n\n```\nnpm install node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Input Node\n\nThe input node receive device commands from the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.\n\nThe node can connect as either a Device or Gateway:\n\n  - **Device**: the node can be configured to either receive all commands for\n      the Device, or just select a specific command type.\n  - **Gateway**: the node can be configured to receive commands for all devices\n      connected through the gateway, or to select a subset of them.\n\nThe message sent by this node will include the following properties:\n\n   - `payload` - the body of the command. If the command was identified as json,\n    this property will be a JavaScript object, otherwise it will be a string.\n   - `topic` - the topic the command was received on\n   - `command` - the command name\n   - `format` - the format of the command\n   - `deviceType` - (*gateway only*) the type of device the command is for\n   - `deviceId` - (*gateway only*) the id of the device the command is for\n\n\n### Output Node\n\nSend device events to the IBM Watson Internet of Things Platform.\n\nThe node can connect as either a Device or Gateway, in registered mode or using\nthe Quickstart service.\n\nWhen connecting using the Quickstart service, the connection will use a device\ntype of `node-red-ibmwiotp` and a randomly generated device id, which can be\nconfigured in the node. The events from the node can then be viewed on the [Quickstart dashboard](https://quickstart.internetofthings.ibmcloud.com/).\n\nThe type of the event sent can be configured in the node or, if left blank, can\nbe set by the `msg.event` property.\n\nThe format of the event defaults to `json`, but can be set to another value or,\nif left blank, can be set by the `msg.format` property.\n\nThe data for the event is taken from `msg.payload`. If `format` is set to `json`,\nthis node will attempt to encode the data appropriately:\n\n  - If the data is an Object of the form: `{ d: { ... }}` it will be used as-is.\n    Similarly if it is a string representation of such an object no further\n    encoding will be done.\n  - For any other type of object, for example a Number, it will be sent as `{\"d\":{\"value\":123}}`\n\nIf `format` is set to anything else, the data will be passed on as-is.\n\nWhen connected as a Gateway, the type and id of the Device the event is being\nsent on behalf of can be configured in the node or, if left blank, can be set by\nthe `msg.deviceType` and `msg.deviceId` properties. If these properties are not\nprovided, either in the node or the message, it will use the type and id of the\nGateway itself.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"amitmangalvedkar","email":"amitmangalvedkar@gmail.com"},{"name":"jeffdare","email":"jeffdare@in.ibm.com"},{"name":"knolleary","email":"nick.oleary@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-13T20:20:11.688Z","created":"2016-02-23T14:20:25.443Z","0.1.0":"2016-02-23T14:20:25.443Z","0.2.0":"2016-02-26T10:33:35.387Z","0.2.1":"2016-03-01T22:16:31.145Z","0.2.2":"2016-03-08T17:07:51.834Z","0.2.3":"2016-03-08T17:09:46.200Z","0.2.4":"2016-03-17T15:37:52.688Z","0.2.5":"2016-03-29T12:19:46.406Z","0.2.6":"2016-06-13T15:36:42.208Z"},"keywords":["node-red","bluemix","watson","iot","ibm"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"https://github.com/ibm-messaging/iot-nodered/tree/master/node-red-contrib-ibm-watson-iot"},"author":{"name":"Nick O'Leary","email":"nick.oleary@gmail.com"},"license":"Apache-2.0","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"bigdoods":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"57ffec7b-3825\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 13 Oct 2016 20:20:11 GMT"}
